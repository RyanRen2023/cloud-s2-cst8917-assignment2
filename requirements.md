# CST8917 – Serverless Applications

## Assignment 2 – Serverless Service Alternatives Report

**Due:** Week 15 (August 15, 2025) – Submit GitHub repository link via Brightspace by 11:59 PM  
**Weight:** 10% of Final Grade  
**Type:** Individual Assignment  

---

## Objective
In this course, we have developed and deployed serverless applications using **Microsoft Azure** services.  
The goal of this assignment is to **broaden your cloud provider knowledge** by researching and identifying **equivalent services** in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for each Azure serverless service we studied.  
You will then **compare** these services in terms of features, triggers/bindings, integration options, monitoring, and pricing.  

You will present your findings in **Markdown format** within a **GitHub repository** to simulate real-world technical documentation practices.

## Instructions

### 1. Required Azure Services to Compare
At a minimum, your report must include the following Azure services:

- **Azure Functions** (Triggers & Bindings)  
- **Durable Functions** (Chaining, Orchestration, Fan-out/Fan-in)  
- **Azure Logic Apps**  
- **Azure Service Bus** (Queues & Topics)  
- **Azure Event Grid**  
- **Azure Event Hubs**  

*(You may include additional Azure services from the course if relevant.)*

### 2. Find AWS & GCP Equivalents
For each Azure service:

- Identify the **closest AWS equivalent service**  
- Identify the **closest GCP equivalent service**

### 3. Compare the Services
For each service, include:

- **Overview** – brief description of each service  
- **Core Features** – supported triggers, bindings, messaging/eventing capabilities  
- **Integration Options** – how it works with other cloud services or CI/CD pipelines  
- **Monitoring & Observability** – available tools/logging integrations  
- **Pricing Model** – high-level cost considerations  
- **Strengths & Weaknesses** – from a serverless architecture perspective  

### 4. Organize in Markdown
- Create a `README.md` file in your GitHub repository containing your report  
- Use **headings**, **tables**, and **bullet points** for clarity  
- Include a **comparison table** for each service, followed by a **narrative analysis**
