## 1. Azure Functions (Triggers & Bindings)

### Overview
**Azure Functions** is a serverless compute service offered by Microsoft as part of the Azure cloud platform. It enables users to **build and run applications without managing servers**. Developers write small, single-purpose pieces of code, or "functions," that perform specific tasks and are **triggered by events**. The cloud provider automatically handles server provisioning and maintenance, abstracting away infrastructure concerns from the app development process.

## 6. Azure Event Hubs

### Overview
**Azure Event Hubs** is a highly scalable data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It is specifically recommended for **streaming events at a high throughput**. Unlike Service Bus's pub/sub model which pushes events and has no replay, Event Hubs write events to a log, allowing consumers to read events anytime and even replay them.

## Conclusion

From this comparison:
- Azure Functions offers the richest binding ecosystem.
- Durable Functions is more feature-rich for orchestration than GCP Workflows.
- Logic Apps has the largest ready-to-use connector library.
- Service Bus provides advanced enterprise messaging patterns.
- Event Grid and Event Hubs integrate deeply with Azureâ€™s analytics and streaming ecosystem.

For cross-cloud flexibility, AWS and GCP offer competitive equivalents but often require more manual integration or multiple services to match Azureâ€™s single-service feature sets.
